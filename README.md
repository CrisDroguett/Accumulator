# Accumulator
Accumulator Integration Layout
•	•	Created XOR, NAND, and INV logic gates in Electric using PMOS and NMOS transistors
•	Upscaled DFF and FA schematics and layout to 16-bit while passing DRC, ERC, and NCC checks
•	Integrated 16-bit DFF and FA into a 16-bit accumulator that correctly simulated output increasing from 1 to 5050
•	Successfully interconnected over 1000 transistors in layout of 16-bit accumulator
